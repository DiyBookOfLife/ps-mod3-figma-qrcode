# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). In this project, I practiced translating a figma design to HTML & CSS.

### What I learned

I learned how to read the typography styles in figma, to translate them to CSS. By clicking on the text, the toolbar on the right hand size shows the font-size, family, color, line-height, etc. I was able to then take these styles and apply them using CSS. 

### Continued development

In the future, I will use this project to to practice integrating either bootstrap or tailwind.
